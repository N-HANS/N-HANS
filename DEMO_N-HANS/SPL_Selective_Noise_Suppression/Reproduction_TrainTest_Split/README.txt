For reproduction of our results in the submitted paper "Single-Channel Selective Noise Suppression: Suppressing Only Unwanted Noise while Retaining Naturalness" for Signal Processing Letters, we provide our Librispeech [1] and AudioSet [2] data split each in train.txt, valid.txt, and test.txt files. The split for the Librispeech corpus is identical as in [1]. More details of the data processing are introduced in Section II in our submitted paper.
